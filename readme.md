# LED Fire Animation with Accelerometer Control

This project implements an LED fire animation controlled by an accelerometer using an ATmega328/128 microcontroller. It utilizes Binary Code Modulation (BCM) for smooth LED brightness control and incorporates an LIS3DH accelerometer for tilt and tap detection.

## Features
* _Fire Animation:_ Simulates a realistic fire effect on a strip of LEDs.
* _Accelerometer Control:_
  * Tilt the device to control the direction of the fire.
  * Tap the device to create a spark.
* _Low Power Mode:_ Automatically enters a low-power sleep mode when the animation is idle.
* _Binary Code Modulation (BCM):_ Provides smooth brightness control for the LEDs.
